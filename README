# shopify-clj

Shopify API adapter for Clojure.

## Usage

To generate password from parameters received in URL just pass them as second
parameter (as struct) to generate-password function, along with map containing
shared secret value (with :shared-secret as key) as first parameter.  To use
API method just pass map with parameters to function like shopify-(verb),
where verb can be any of read, create, update and delete as first parameter
and route as "/action" string, e.g. "/products". Optional third parameter
specifies parameter map.

Examples:

Generating password:

user> (generate-password (struct password-credentials "sharedsecret1234") 
			 {"shop" "xxx1234.myshopify.com", "timestamp" "1133831885", 
			 "signature" "ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss", "t" "tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt"})

{:shared-secret "sharedsecret1234", :password "somepassword5678"}

Asking for products:

(shopify-read (struct request-credentials "xxx1234.myshopify.com" 
			    "apikey1234" "somepassword5678" 
			    "sharedsecret1234")
	      "/products")

{"products" ...}
